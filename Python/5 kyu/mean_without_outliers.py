"""
The mean and standard deviation of a sample of data can be thrown off if the
sample contains one or many outlier(s) :


For this reason, it is usually a good idea to check for and remove outliers
before computing the mean or the standard deviation of a sample. To this aim,
your function will receive a list of numbers representing a sample of data.
Your function must remove any outliers and return the mean of the sample,
rounded to two decimal places (round only at the end).

Since there is no objective definition of "outlier" in statistics, your
function will also receive a cutoff, in standard deviation units. So for
example if the cutoff is 3, then any value that is more than 3 standard
deviations above or below the mean must be removed. Notice that, once outlying
values are removed in a first "sweep", other less extreme values may then
"become" outliers, that you'll have to remove as well!

Example :

sample = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 100]
cutoff = 3
clean_mean(sample, cutoff) â†’ 5.5

Note : since we are not computing the sample standard deviation for inferential
purposes, the denominator is n, not n - 1.
