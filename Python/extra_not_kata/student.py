""" 
Suppose you have students (defined by the class Student) who each have an 
amount of money (in bills of five, ten and twenty euro). We want to be able to 
compare them based on their wealth. Let's create a class Student which will store 
all their information and help with comparing

Specs
When initializing a Student, you should require 4 additional arguments, the student's
name and the number of bills they own (fives, tens and twenties)
Implement a wealth method on Student. When called it should return the total wealth of the student
Implement a compare method which takes one argument, another student, and returns the name of 
the richer student
Optional
Implement an advanced_compare method which takes one argument, a list of students. When called, 
it should return a list of all the student's names sorted from most wealthy to least wealthyâ€¦.
don't forget to include the student instance the method was called on in the sort ðŸ˜‰

Hint - This stackoverflow post might help
