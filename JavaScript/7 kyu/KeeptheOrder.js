/* Task:
Your job here is to write a function (keepOrder in JS/CoffeeScript, keep_order in Ruby/Crystal/Python, keeporder in Julia), which takes a sorted array ary and a value val, and returns the lowest index where you could insert val to maintain the sorted-ness of the array. The input array will always be sorted in ascending order. It may contain duplicates.

Do not modify the input.

Some examples:
keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4, 7], 5) //=> 4
                      ^(index 4)
keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4, 7], 0) //=> 0
          ^(index 0)
keepOrder([1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 2) //=> 2
                ^(index 2)

/* const keepOrder = (ary, val) => {
  const resultFind = ary.indexOf(ary.find((el) => el >= val));

  return resultFind != -1 ? resultFind : Number(ary.splice(-1));
}; */

const keepOrder = (ary, val) => ary.concat(val).sort().indexOf(val);

//testing

console.log(keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4, 7], 5)); //4
console.log(keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4], -1)); //0
console.log(keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)); //4
console.log(keepOrder([1, 2, 3, 4], 3)); //3
