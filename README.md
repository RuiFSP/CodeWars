my repository for code war solutions in different languages

These are my solutions to [codewars](http://codewars.com). 
My profile in codewars can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/rui3). Languages used here are (at the moment):

This is my Codewarrior Profile Badge, current status:

* Java (mainly)
* JavaScript (gdid alot in the past)
* Python (want to improve)
* SQL (from time to time)
* C++ (for the fun of it)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

As stated above, this repo includes my own solutions and just posting them helps me keep the pace, code on a 
daily basis, and improve as a developer. But..., **please do not use them** to cheat on the platform! In this regard, 
I deeply encourage you to pay attention to the following guidelines:

* Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches.
* Codewarriors should not submit my solutions as their own.
* I will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo.
* Creating a repository like this is discouraged by Codewars. (-> _in fact I had myself overlooked this one, sorry CW!_)

Thank you!
