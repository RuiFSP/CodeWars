# CodeWars
**Codewars** is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.On Codewars the community and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and quality solutions

Languages used here are (at the moment):

* [Java](https://github.com/RuiFSP/CodeWars/tree/main/Java)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/RuiFSP/CodeWars/tree/main/JavaScript) 
* [Python](https://github.com/RuiFSP/CodeWars/tree/main/Python) 


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

* Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches.
* Codewarriors should not submit my solutions as their own.


Thank you!
